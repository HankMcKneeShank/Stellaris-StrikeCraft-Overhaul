    * Increased **attackrange** of bombers from 8 to 10 / of fighters from 8 to 8.5
    * Decreased fighter **launch time** from 1.5 to 1.0
    * Increased fighter **speed** from 300/350/400 to 350/400/450
    * Increased **rotationspeed** of bombers from 0.1 to 0.2 _(Huge difference in performance!)_ / of fighters from 0.1 to 0.215

       * **Damage** adjusted , Tier1/Tier2/Tier3 are now semi-equivalent in performance L slots :
        * Tier 1 can be compared to a (kinetic battery - ~ 25% damage) @ vesselcount of 10
        * Tier 2 can be compared to a (kinetic battery + ~ 8% damage) @ vesselcount of 10
        * Tier 3 can be compared to a (Kinetic Artillery + ~ 10% damage) @ vesselcount of 10
        !! **(Also compareable to other L slots , K.A. is just used as an example)** !!

      * **Acceleration** increased from 0.5 to 1
